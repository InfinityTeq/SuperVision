## Overview:
SuperVision is an open source *"Google Maps"* for hackers developed by [CosmodiumCS][ccs]. SuperVision's map centralizes public data and maps it. Allowing you to see traffic cameras, transportation, and other data systems **in live time**. It is developed with a type of hacking called "Public Data Hacking" [PDH]. This is basically the process in which you exploit data thats publically available. Whats cool about PDH is that its completely legal, because the data we exploit is already publically available. So by the magical powers of Python, JavaScript, and several markup languages, we generate a powerful map that is ready to use whenever you need! 

**How It Works:**

SuperVision works by using Python to generate Keyhole Makrup Language [KML] files. KML files are used to map geographic data. There is a [KML]() directory that contains all of the generated KML files used in this project. These files can be imported into Google Earth and you will be able to view all of the markers showing the cameras and other public data that SuperVision has mapped. But Google Earth has two problems...

1. Google Earth is **NOT** open source
2. Google Earth only maps data statically

SuperVision open source magic allows us to do so much more than what propriatary software limited us to. SuperVision has not only mapped thing like cameras, but it can track live data like the locations of public transportation. We can fully customize the tracking of public data to the fullest extent possible [with a lot of debugging of course XP]. SuperVision serves to aid security research and become a reminder of the level of government surveillance that exists today. SuperVision got all its shit from a lot of googling, I can to do this in my spare time, i can only imagine the level of automated surveillance the government is capable of.

## Requirements:
- A Modern Web Browser
    - i.e [Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari]
- An Internet Connection

## Data Policy
- SuperVision **only** asks for your device's approximate location. If you say yes it will display the available data closest to you. If you say no, it will display all the full map. 
- SuperVision **does not** collect any user data...read the code 

## Credits
The original concept comes from an old friend of mine, Shepherd. We worked After a split between us
